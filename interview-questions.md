# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
Props are arguments that are related to components.

  Researched answer:
Props are arguments which hold the values of the variables that are passed from Parent component to child component. Props will always have one direction in which they pass information: parent to child. Additionally, props cannot be updated which implies they are "read only." "Read only" can be defined as values that define the starting point for a component.


2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
A DOM event is whenever a individual does anything on the user-interface side.

  Researched answer:
DOM events are actions that occur as a result of a user action or as a result of a change in the DOM tree. This can occur by registering different event handlers on elements. Event handlers are JS code that are invoked when a particular user action has occured. There are seven DOM event types: (1) User interface events, (2) Focus events, (3) Mouse events, (4) Wheel events, (5) Input events, (6) Keyboard Events, and (7) Composition events. (Won't get into detail about the seven).


3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm to create containers for data. I believe the difference between OOP and functional programming is that data is not stored, however in OOP data is stored in the objects.

  Researched answer:
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm which is based on the concepts of "objects." Instead of using functions, OOP organizes everything around objects. This allows developers create containers that allow them to manipulate data without affecting everything else.

The difference in between functional programming and OOP is that data cannot be stored in functions, thus in OOP data can be stored in objects. OOP is generally better when an developer has a fixed set of operations of data, in which new things can be added. However, functional programming is generally better when a developer has a fixed set of things, in which they will primarily add new functions on existing things.


4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:
I believe a float is any number containing decimals, while integers are whole numbers.

  Researched answer:
Both are numerical data, but floats are numbers that contain decimals for more precision, while intergers are whole numbers: positive, negative and 0.


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
When creating a method in ruby, there is no need for a return. Ruby will automatically return the last instructed code.

  Researched answer:
An implicit return means that the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned without the need of a keyword.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable:
Instance variables give objects a private space to store data. These variables will start with an @ symbol. You will define instance variables inside a class. Instance variables are encapsulated, thus cannot be access outside of the class.

2. PostgreSQL:
PostgreSQL is an open source relational databased that supports both SQL and JSON. It is primarily used to store data for web, mobile and geospatial, and analytic applications. Additionally, relational database are a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that have pre-defined relationships between them.

3. Ruby on Rails:
Ruby on rails is a server-side web application framework. Rails is a framework that uses Ruby language to create websites.

4. ORM:
Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique which allows accessing relational database using OOP. This techinque allows for storing, retrieving, and updating and deleting from a object-oriented program in a relational database. Utilizes a "data layer" which manages translation between objected-oriented and relational.

5. Active Record:
Active record is the ORM supplied by Rails. It allows for interaction with data that are stored in database tables.
